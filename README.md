# wrappedify

Rudimentary data analysis algorithm used to create a "wrapped" summary of usersâ€™ Spotify listening (similar to Spotify's end-of-the-year Wrapped) using Spotify's API and various Python libraries. Allows users to view up-to-date listening statistics such as top artists, favorite songs, and most-listened-to genres. Future goals include launching a website with a HTML/CSS/JavaScript front end and a Python back end (or perhaps all HTML/CSS/JavaScript?) and implementing more features for data-savvy users.
